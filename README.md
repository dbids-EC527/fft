# Fast Fourier Transform in 2D using the Cooley-Tukey Algorithm
## By Devin Bidstrup

This repository contains code to implement:
* [2D Cooley-Tukey FFT on the CPU](/base_code/fft_2d.c)
* [2D Cooley-Tukey FFT on the CPU on a sample image](./image_code/fft_2d_image.c)
* [2D Cooley-Tukey FFT on the GPU using shared memory per row](./gpu_code/fft_gpu_paralleli.cu)

Compilation instructions and sources are found at the top of all files.
