# Fast Fourier Transform in 2D using the Cooley-Tukey Algorithm
## By Devin Bidstrup

This repository contains code to implement:
* 1D Cooley-Tukey FFT on the CPU.
* 2D Cooley-Tukey FFT on the CPU.
* 2D Cooley-Tukey FFT on the CPU on a sample image.
* 2D Cooley-Tukey FFT on the GPU using shared memory per row.

Compilation instructions and sources are found at the top of all files.
